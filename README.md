> _Hermes is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology. Moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine,
 he is portrayed as emissary and the messenger of the gods._

> _Hermes suffers from no limit. He loves to outwit other gods for his own satisfaction or for the sake of humankind._


`Hermes` is a lightweight, cross-platform, thread-safe, asynchronous, `C++11` network library.

## Requirement

- C++11 only.

## Compile

Hermes is a header only library, there is nothing to build and to link with your program. You just need to include
the `Hermes.hpp` header.

 - Download Hermes:

```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/TommyStarK/Hermes.git
```

- Include header:

```cpp
   #include "Hermes.hpp"
```

## Documentation

A [Full documentation](https://github.com/TommyStarK/Hermes/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) is available.


## Contribution

Each Contribution is welcomed and encouraged. I do not claim to cover each use cases nor completely master the c++. If you encounter a non sense or any trouble, you can open an issue
and I will be happy to discuss about it.
